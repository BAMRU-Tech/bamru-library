## Demo Site & User Guide

A working (read only) demo of Library is available **TKTK**. The site contains
instructions for how to get the most out of Library.

## Development Workflow

1. Clone and `cd` into the repo:

   `git clone git@github.com:newsdev/nyt-library.git && cd nyt-library`


2. From the Google API console, create a service account with API access to docs
   and cloud datastore. Store these credentials in `server/.auth.json`.

   - If you are working with oAuth, you will also need to create oAuth credentials.

3. Install dependencies:

   `yarn install --ignore-optional`

4. Create a `.env` file at the project root. An example `.env` might look like

```bash
NODE_ENV=development # node environment
# Google oAuth credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=123456-abcdefg.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=abcxyz12345
APPROVED_DOMAINS="nytimes.com,dailypennsylvanian.com" # comma separated list of approved access domains.
SESSION_SECRET=supersecretvalue

# Google drive Configuration
DRIVE_TYPE=team # or shared, if using a folder instead of a team drive
DRIVE_ID=0123456ABCDEF # the ID of your team's drive
```

5. Start the app:

   `npm run build && npm run watch`

The app should now be running at localhost:3000.

### Tests
You can run functional and unit tests, which test HTML parsing and routing logic, with `npm test`. A coverage report can be generated by running `npm run test:cover`.

<!-- NB this needs to change eventually -->
The HTML parsing tests are based on the [Supported Formats doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/***REMOVED***/edit).  To download a fresh copy of the HTML after making edits, run `node test/data/update.js`.

### Google Drive Beta API
You must also set a `API_KEY` environment variable to a key created by a whitelisted
organization if you wish to use the Google Docs v4 API. While this API does not
currently support all the necessary features for a full implementation, you can
render a page using the beta API by appending the `?beta` query string, or setting
the `USE_BETA` environment variable to `true`.

## Customization
Styles, text, middleware, caching logic, and middleware can be customized to
match the branding of your organization. This is covered in the [customization readme](https://github.com/newsdev/nyt-library/blob/master/custom/README.md).


## Deploying the app

### Using Heroku
**Heroku deploy TKTKTKT**

### Using Docker
**Docker deploy TKTKTKT**

### Standard Deployment
Library is a standard node app, so it can be deployed just about anywhere. If you are looking to deploy to a standard VPS, [Digital Ocean's tutorials](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-16-04) are a great resource.

## App structure

### Server
The main entry point to the app is `index.js`.

This file contains the a express server which will respond to requests for docs
in the configured team drive or shared folder. Additionally, it contains logic
about issuing 404s and selecting the template to use based on the path.

### Views
Views (layouts) are located in the `layouts` folder. They use the `.ejs`
extension, which uses a syntax similar to underscore templates.

Base styles for the views are in the `styles` directory containing Sass files.
These files are compiled to CSS and placed in `public/css`.

### Doc parsing
Doc HTML fetch and parsing is handled by `docs.js`. `fetchDoc` takes the ID of a
Google doc and a callback, then passes the HTML of the document into the
callback once it has ben downloaded and processed.

### Listing the drive
Traversing the contents of the NYT Docs folder is handled by `list.js`. There
are two exported functions:

* `getTree` is an async call that returns a nested hash (tree) of Google Drive
  Folder IDs mapped to their children. It is used by the server to determine
  whether a route is valid or not.

* `getMeta` synchronously returns a hash of Google Doc IDs to metadata objects
  that were saved in the course of populating the tree. This metadata includes
  edit history, document authors, and parent folders.

The tree and file metadata are repopulated into memory on an interval (currently 60s). Calling getTree multiple times will not return fresher data.

### Auth

Authentication with the Google Drive v3 api is handled by the auth.js file, which exposes a single method `getAuth`. `getAuth` will either return an already instantiated authentication client or produce a fresh one. Calling `getAuth` multiple times will not produce a new authentication client if the credentials have expired; we should build this into the auth.js file later to automatically refresh the credentials on some sort of interval to prevent them from expiring.
